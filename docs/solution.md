# FinanceApp Solution Documentation

## Issue Identified

The application was showing the default React Native startup message "Open up App.js to start working on your app!" instead of displaying the actual Finance application. This occurred because:

1. The main `App.js` file contained the default React Native template code instead of importing and using the actual application components from the `src` directory.
2. The navigation dependencies required by the application were not installed in the project.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated App.js

The `App.js` file was modified to import and use the `AppNavigator` component from the `src/navigation` directory:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar';
import AppNavigator from './src/navigation/AppNavigator';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <StatusBar style="auto" />
      <AppNavigator />
    </>
  );
}
```

This change replaces the default template code with the actual application navigation structure.

### 2. Installed Missing Dependencies

The following navigation dependencies were installed, which are required by the `AppNavigator.js` file:

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/bottom-tabs @react-navigation/stack react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
```

These packages provide the navigation functionality used in the application.

## Explanation

The repository had a proper structure with all the necessary components, screens, and navigation setup in the `src` directory. However, the main `App.js` file was not importing and using these components. Instead, it contained the default React Native template code that displays the "Open up App.js" message.

Additionally, the navigation dependencies required by the `AppNavigator.js` file were not listed in the `package.json` and were not installed in the project. This would have caused errors even if the `App.js` file had been properly configured.

By updating the `App.js` file to use the `AppNavigator` component and installing the missing navigation dependencies, the application should now display the proper UI with the bottom tab navigation as defined in the `AppNavigator.js` file.
